# Pose estimation and Augmented Reality

Welcome to this lab in the computer vision course [TEK5030] at the University of Oslo.

In this lab we will implement pose estimation based on 2D-3D correspondences from scratch!

**Start** by cloning this repository on your machine. 

Then, open the project in PyCharm.
If you are uncertain about how this is done, please take a look at [the intro lab].

The lab is carried out by following these steps:

1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Camera calibration](lab-guide/2-camera-calibration.md)
3. [Implement homography-based pose estimation](lab-guide/3-implement-homography-based-pose-estimation.md)
4. [Experiment with Motion-only Bundle Adjustment](lab-guide/4-experiment-with-motion-only-bundle-adjustment.md)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
